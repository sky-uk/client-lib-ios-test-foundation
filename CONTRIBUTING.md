## Contributing to Sky Test Foundation

Thank you for your interest in Sky Test Foundation! There are multiple ways you can contribute to this project. We welcome contributions in all areas, with special attention to:

* [Issue fixes](#issue-fixes)
* [Semantic improvements](#semantic-improvements)
* [Performance improvements](#performance-improvements)
* [Documentation improvements](#documentation-improvements)

Please take the time to carefully read the following guide. These rules help make the best out of your time, the code reviewer's time and the general consistency of the project.

### General rules

All contributions are handled via Pull Requests (PRs). Your PR _must_ target the `develop` branch. This is the place where we aggregate all upcoming changes for the next release of Sky Test Foundation. Moreover, your PR _must_ provide a meaningful description of what it is about.

We suggest using ([Gitflow](http://nvie.com/posts/a-successful-git-branching-model/) branching model).

Don't forget to update `CHANGELOG.md` before pushing your PR. While text may be re-worded before release, but it'll help tracking the changes.

Quick checklist summary before submitting a PR:

* üîé Make sure tests are added or updated to accomodate your changes. We do not accept any addition that come without tests. When possible, add tests to verify bug fixes and prevent future regressions.
* üìñ Check that you provided a CHANGELOG entry documenting your changes (except for documentation improvements)
* üëå Verify that tests pass
* üëç Push it!

### Issue fixes

Fixing issues is a good way to start contributing and getting used to the large codebase in project! You may want to look at outstanding reported issues, or maybe you bumped into an issue that you found. In the latter case, please make sure you first open an issue in the issue tracker here on GitHub and indicate that you're working on a fix. This will give a chance to other contributors to chime in, and help tracking who's working on what in order to avoid duplicate work.

Once you believe the issue is fixed, make sure the tests pass (see above) then open a Pull Request.

Congratulations on contributing a fix! We love receiving new bug fixes and your help is very much welcomed.

### Semantic improvements

Being able to express tests declaratively, elegantly and shortly is not an easy task and there's always room left for improvement. If you think you can improve how to write a test in Sky Test Foundation, create a new issue and explain with as much as details as possible, how your idea can improve the library, highlighting the advantages over the current approach and eventual tradeoffs. Discussing the matter via an issue is a preferred starting point. This will allow other contributors to join and express their point of view, allowing for a smooth glide from problem description to resolution.

### Performance improvements

We take performance very much to heart. Sky Test Foundation is at the core of some large products. Performance improvements are always welcome! If you identified a bottleneck, please make sure you follow the performance fix procedure:

* Prepare a reproducible case that highlights the performance issue, if possible. At least, the case should provide a testable timing result.
* Submit a PR with a fix that provides a measurable performance improvement
* Think hard about all the use cases! Threading and concurrency are important to think about when it comes to performance, make sure your fix doesn't come with a performance regression in some use cases.

As previously highlighted, discussing the matter via an issue is a preferred starting point. This will allow other contributors to join and express their point of view, allowing for a smooth glide from problem description to resolution.

Thanks for caring about performance! Sky Test Foundation is a crucial component of many applications and performance issues can have a wide impact.

### Documentation improvements

Sky Test Foundation is a complex testing library, which allows for a variety of different use cases. Documenting them providing examples is crucial for library adoption. The more examples and scenarios, the better. Obviously, it's not possibile to document every single use case in the world, but we aim to document most common scenarios and usages, promoting best practices through examples. We very much need a documentation that is as good, as as up-to-date as possible!

We understand the need for foreign language documentation. Unfortunately, due to the scope and breadth of the project it's a tough promise to keep up-to-date documentation in other languages than English. Moreover, all contributors only have English as a common language on the project. Therefore, and to keep the project as maintainable as possible, we only accept documentation changes and improvements provided in English. If you're looking at providing a translation of the in-line documentation, please make sure you have the resources and time to keep it updated as the framework changes. We care a lot about the quality of both the code and its documentation, over the long term. Maintaining a foreign language translation is a longtime commitment that should not be taken lightly.

Thank you for your interest in helping with documentation! Your contributions will make the life of other developers easier.
