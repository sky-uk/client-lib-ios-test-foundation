Test suite for iOS mobile applications: a collection of tools and classes to facilitate the writing of automatic tests during development of an iOS mobile application.
The suite has to parts, one for Unit testing and the other one for User Interface (or functional) tests.
## Test Environment
During tests execution, iOS Mobile App (MA) should interact with a Mock Server which appear to be the real counterparts of BE server. The framework provides a mock server that allows a tight control over what data the iOS App receives.

### Unit Test Template with SUT performing Http Requests
The goal of this kind of unit test is to verify the correctness of the http requests performed by the MA. The `httpServerBuilder` object allows to define the state of the mock server as a set of http routes. Note `FakeMySkyAppSDK.localhost()` in the `setupUp()` forwards http request performed by MA to localhost.
```swift
class CustomerRepositoryTests: SkyUnitTestCase {

    var sut: AddressServices!

     override func setUp() {
        super.setUp()
        let sdk = FakeMySkyAppSDK.localhost()     // forwards MSA's http requests to 127.0.0.0:8080 
        sdk.services.selfCare.customerRepository.clearAll(removingUserSelections: true)
        sut = sdk.services.selfCare.address
    }
    
    func testGetNormalizedCities() throws {
        // Given
        let query = "Milano"
        let citiesResponse = [City.mock(egonId: String.mock(), name: String.mock(), province: String.mock())]

        try httpServerBuilder.route(Endpoint.Selfcare.cities.urlPath) { (request, callCount) -> (HttpResponse) in
            XCTAssertEqual(request.method, ReactiveAPIHTTPMethod.get.rawValue)
            XCTAssertEqual(request.queryParam("q"), query)
            XCTAssertEqual(request.headers["egon-route"], true.stringValue)
            let data = try! JSONHelper.encode(value: citiesResponse)
            return HttpResponse.ok(HttpResponseBody.data(data))

        }.onUnexpected { (request) in

            UnexepctedRequestFail(request)

        }.buildAndStart()
    
        // When
        let streamed = try sut.getNormalizedCities(query: query).toBlocking().single()
        // Then
        XCTAssertNotNil(streamed)
        XCTAssertEqual(streamed.first, citiesResponse.first)
    }
}
```

where 

```swift
func UnexepctedRequestFail(_ request: Swifter.HttpRequest, file: StaticString = #file, line: UInt = #line) {
    XCTFail("Url request not stubbed: \(String(describing: request.path))", file: file, line: line)
}
```
Note: `Endpoint.Selfcare.cities.urlPath` is a relative path not containing `127.0.0.1:8080`.
The `testGetNormalizedCities` is composed by 3 sections:
- Given: mocks and http routes are defined
- When: call to method of SUT (system under test) to be tested
- Then: expected values assertions
If the execution of the method under test performs an http request not handled by the mocks server then `onUnexpected`'s clousure `(HttpRequest) -> ()` is called.
